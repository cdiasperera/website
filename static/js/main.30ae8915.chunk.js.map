For those unaware, a genetic\n          algorithm tries to find a solution via a simulation of\n        <i> evolution </i>, where the organisms that evolve are \"solutions\" to the problem.\n          In principle, better solutions should naturally arise\n          and given that there's a \"correct solution\" for this problem, over a\n          long enough iteration period, we should reach the correct solution.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n          The problem itself was the <b>(multi)set partition problem </b>, which\n          involved  creating two disjoint sets from the original set, such\n          that their sums are the same. A good analogy would be to imagine the\n          original set as a collection of wooden cuboids of different lengths. The goal\n          is to create two piles of cuboids, such that when you stack up each\n          pile, their heights are the same.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>The project and some analysis</h2>\n      <p>\n            Below is a link to the github repository storing the code and\n            instructions on how to use the program. I've also included a link to\n            the report I wrote on the project.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href='https://github.com/cdiasperera/GeneticPartitionProblem'>\n              Project Source\n        </a>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <a href={report}> Download report</a>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The bulk of the code revolves around writing functions to simulate\n        various aspects of evolution. Me and Ola felt this was a simple enough\n        project to implement in C, though maybe it might have benefitted from\n        being implemented in some OOP langauge.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Writing the code was simple enough, and it took only a few days.\n        Really, the trouble involved finding the best set of parameters for\n        the simulation, so it doesn't take too long to find a solution. And that\n        took multiple weeks worth of work.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Unfortunately, a lot of our analysis (to find those parameters) was somewhat rotten when we realized\n        that our program fails spectacularly on difficult original sets.  The problem was that we were\n        optimising for speed on relatively simple input sets, without checking that our parameters were sufficient\n        for more complex input sets. We had to scrap a lot of code (most of which\n        can be found in the history of <code>testing.c</code>).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Still, while we couldn't exactly find the optimal set of parameters for our simulation,\n        we were able to measure the performance of our program. The core performance parameter being\n        \"How often do we get a correct answer\". Remember, as our program is probabilistic, there's no guarantee\n        that we would arrive at a correct solution.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n          This parameter was dependent on another parameter: \"<i>How long do we let our solution   evolve </i>\".\n          Graphing these two parameters against each other yields the following:\n        <div class={styles.T2Trend}>\n          <img\n            src={t2Graph}\n            alt='How our program performs as t_2 increases'\n          />\n        </div>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        To explain the axes, the independent axis is roughly how long we would let\n        our simulation evolve for. The independent axis is more interesting. When\n        given an arbitrary data set, you do not know the answer before hand (since\n        that's the objective of the program), so you cannot know if, by the end\n        of the simulation, you came to the right solution.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        That said, you can track how often the <it>same</it> answer pops up, over\n        multiple generations. And for simulations that evolve long enough, the best\n        answer is almost certainly the solution. Hence, we need to track how often\n        the best answer re-appears, which is:\n        <ul>\n          <li> What the dependent axis is</li>\n          <li> The performance parameter we are tracking</li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n            We can see that initially, the solution improves linearly, the\n            longer we let the simulation run. However, at a certain point, it\n            starts to behave logarithmcally.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Conclusions</h2>\n      <p>\n            I'm relatively happy with the project, though I am disappointed with\n            the analysis of it. I couldn't really find a way to find the best\n            parameters for the configuration. At least, not in a way that would\n            have allowed us to complete the project on time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n            It also takes multiple seconds to run. Some of the input cases could\n            be optimized, but it doesn't sit right with me for it to take so\n            long, for a relatively tiny input set size.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n            That said, the improvements I could make to the project are probably\n            not worth the investment, which could be put into more effective\n            places so I'm willing to call the project <b> done </b>.\n      </p>\n\n    </Post>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default IntroToCSProj\n","import React from 'react'\nimport Post from '../../hoc/Post'\n\nimport yelpcamp from '../../images/yelpcamp.png'\n\nimport styles from './YelpCamp.module.css'\n\nconst YelpCamp = () => {\n  return (\n    <Post>\n      <h1> My first website: YelpCamp</h1>\n      <p>\n        Yonks ago, back before I even starting programming seriously, I made a\n        simply CRUD website, following a course on <a href='https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/'> Udemy </a>.\n        It was a Yelp-clone for camping sites around the United States, with an\n        added social-media element to it.

Previously,\n        the course used to be taught with reference to <a href='https://books.google.nl/books/about/Structured_Computer_Organization.html?id=m0HHygAACAAJ&redir_esc=y'>Structured Computer Organization</a>, by Tennenbaum.\n        It's a fantastically <it>dense</it> book, written with great humour. It's\n        certainly one I recommend anyone read, if they are faintly interested in\n        how computers work.\n      </p>\n\n      <p> That said, I have no idea how you would assess someone's knowledge based\n        on that textbook. In some sense, it felt more like a biology textbook, than a\n        mathematics/technology textbook, since there was so much you <b>just had to know</b>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p> So I presume part of the motivation behind picking the new text\n        (<a href='https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/introduction-computing-systems-bits-gates-c-beyond-patt-patel/M9780072467505.html'>Introduction to Computing Systems</a>)\n        was to use a more \"practical\" text. In fact, a whole chapter of this book\n        is dedicated to discussing an assembly language for a toy computer.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Of course, assessment might be easier, but does teaching assembly actually\n        confer any benefits, in teaching computer architecture? In my opinion ... it's a soft yes.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Certainly, to understand Assembly to fully utilize it, you need to understand\n        the underlying ISA well enough, and in my experience, it does cement the concepts\n        quite well.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>However, there really is only so much you can teach with it, since it is\n        essentially a procedural language. At a certain point, all Assembly level\n        concepts have been internalized any development because bog standard\n        structural programming. Hence, I can really only recomemnd it for a short\n        6-8 week long course.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>A project in Assembly</h2>\n      <p>To mark the end of the course, we were assigned a short project to extend\n        the capabilities of the toy computer (called the LC-3) we were working with.\n      </p>\n\n      <p> The LC-3 used a 16-bit memory and all its instructions were implemented\n        as such. Our goal was to extended addition so that it could deal with\n        arbitrarily sized digits (the maximum size given in advance). Furthermore,\n        we had to contend with IO.\n      </p>\n\n      <p> Below is a link to the source code, as well as the report:\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href='https://github.com/cdiasperera/multiWordNumbers'>The source code</a></li>\n          <li><a href={mwn}>The report</a></li>\n        </ul>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>While the project worked to specification, it's really unoptimized.\n        However, it works fast enough for the human eye not to see any noticeable\n        lag, so this isn't an issue.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>The main issue is that it does not truly work with arbitrarily sized\n        numbers, only numbers up to a 100 digits or so. The main issue is that allocating\n        space shifts the starting addresses of locations of key blocks of memory, that my\n        program requires. Then, at a certain point, those addresses are not directly\n        accessible, since they are too far away from the program counter.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Instead, their addresses need to be loaded into a register, at which point\n        they can be accessed. Unfortunately, registers come at a premium and it\n        quite complicates the process. It's certainly not an impossible limitation to fix, just\n        a frustrating one.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Beyond that, I'm fairly happy with the program and I found implementing it fairly\n        educational. I'm not really going to attempt to extend it, since it's more a\n        exercise in tedium than anything else. Hence, I will consider the project closed.\n      </p>\n    </Post>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default WorkingWithAssembly\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { Route } from 'react-router-dom'\n\n// COMPONENTS\nimport Landing from './pages/Landing'\nimport AboutMe from './pages/AboutMe'\nimport Resume from './pages/Resume'\nimport IntroToCSProj from './pages/IntroToCSProj'\nimport YelpCamp from './pages/YelpCamp'\nimport WorkingWithAssembly from './pages/WorkingWithAssembly'\n\nfunction App () {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Route path='/' exact component={Landing} />\n      <Route path='/about-me' exact component={AboutMe} />\n      <Route path='/resume' exact component={Resume} />\n      <Route path='/intro-to-cs-project' exact component={IntroToCSProj} />\n      <Route path='/my-first-website' exact component={YelpCamp} />\n      <Route path='/working-with-assembly' exact component={WorkingWithAssembly} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
